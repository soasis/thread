API
===

There's only a limited number of APIs to document, as the rest is covered by the C11 ``<threads.h>`` documentation. Therefore, we only document the new parts and the additions that this library specializes in.



``ztdc_thrd_attr_err_func_t`` function type
-------------------------------------------

.. doxygentypedef:: ztdc_thrd_attr_err_func_t



``ztdc_thrd_create_attrs_err`` function
---------------------------------------

.. doxygenfunction:: ztdc_thrd_create_attrs_err



``ztdc_thrd_create_attrs`` function
-----------------------------------

.. doxygenfunction:: ztdc_thrd_create_attrs



``ztdc_thrd_attr_kind`` enumeration
-----------------------------------

This enumeration is the core of the library. Every standard

.. doxygenenum:: ztdc_thrd_attr_kind


.. _ztdc_thrd_attr:

``ztdc_thrd_attr_*`` standard structures
----------------------------------------

These are standard structures, useful to dictate behavior across platforms. Certain platforms have different limits on different parts of the attributes for threads: it may take some experimentation to make it work. Every structure has a :cpp:enum:`ztdc_thrd_attr_kind` as the first member in order for the enumerator's address to double as the address of the structure, and allow for well-defined casting to the appropriate type.

.. doxygenstruct:: ztdc_thrd_attr_detached
	:members:



.. _ztdc_thrd_attr_impl:

``ztdc_thrd_attr_*`` implementation-defined structures
------------------------------------------------------

These structures are less portable and do not work across platforms.

.. doxygenstruct:: ztdc_thrd_attr__stack_storage
	:members:

.. doxygenstruct:: ztdc_thrd_attr__stack_guard_size
	:members:
