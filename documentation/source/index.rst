``ztd.thread``
==============

Welcome to the ``ztd.thread`` library, an experimental library for proving out the management of attributes in C code in a way that is drop-in compatible with C11 threads. Currently, there are shims for POSIX threads (so-called "pthreads") and Win32 threads. Either is compatible with ``<pthreads.h>`` on POSIX-based platforms, or ``<xthreads.h>`` on Windows platforms. It also works on such platforms even if it already has a C11 ``<threads.h>`` implemented, and simply works on top of that existing work.

There is currently no ``std::thread``/C++ integration, as it is much harder to crack open a ``std::thread`` type on the various platforms.



Who Is This Library For?
------------------------

Anyone who wants a better way to specify things like the name, or the stack size, of a thread. Additions and more improvements welcome within the ``ztdc_thrd_attr_*`` types and enumerations, implementation-specific or not!
